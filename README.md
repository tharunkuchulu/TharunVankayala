## 💡 About Me

I’m passionate about **building things that matter** — from AI-powered resume analyzers to OTT platforms and automated testing tools. If it’s a challenge, I’m already halfway into it.

I enjoy:
- 🧠 Learning new technologies just for fun (and for breaking things occasionally)
- 💻 Turning UI designs into smooth, responsive, and beautiful interfaces
- 🔍 Solving real-world problems with clean, efficient, scalable code

## 🛠️ Current Projects

- **SkillSync AI** – Helping recruiters match talent with precision using Gen-AI  
- **AI Testing Tool** – Making QA teams redundant... just kidding (or not 😅)  
- **Resume Analyzer** – Upload a resume, match with JD, get insights, export to PDF. Magic.  
- **Cinematic OTT Platform** – Built with React, Redux, MUI, TMDB, and vibes.

## 😄 Fun Facts

- I’ve built projects just to automate 2-click tasks. Overkill? Maybe. Worth it? Always.  
- I name my projects like they're movie titles. Yes, there's a lore.  
- I debug in dark mode. I live in dark mode.  
- I once created an entire UI design in Figma just to build it again with animations in React. That’s called *passion*, not *procrastination*.
